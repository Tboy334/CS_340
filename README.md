How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In order to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, there are many aspects or building blocks a developer can follow. Some of the important ones we used in this project were testing, error handling, and documenation. Through the creation of our CRUD module we could integrate this with our dashboard that allowed the users from the company to create, update, and remove data in real time. This was also able to be seen visual from the GUI dashboard that was created for the users to filter data. This module can be used in future projects to be built upon or modified to meet the needs in other database operations and environments.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

In my current line of work as a system administartor I tend to first identify the problem or objective and then conduct research. This allows me to better understand the problem/challenge in front of me and allows me to devise a plan on how to proceed. In this case I first followed documentation provided to get my feet wet on how to use the database commands and slowly throughout the course added new layers on top of the knowledge to get a better understanding. In the course I ran into many obstacles as I am not fluent with MongoDB and have not had any experience with it. I was able to get through some of these challenges, but there are others I am still stuck with. In the future I would definently need more experience with integrating python modules in with my DB as well as creating html dash framework, as it has been many years since I have devled with html code.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists are a general or broad spectrum of people. These people can provide use to a variety of different positions within companies, whether that be developers, cybersecurity, administration, etc.  With this type of project I beleive a MongoDB admin would be the best fit, along with the assistance of a web database admin and maybe some developers so that the project could be further streamlined and have multiple different perspectives to improve the QOL.
