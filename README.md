How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In order to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, there are many aspects or building blocks a developer can follow. Some of the important ones we used in this project were testing, error handling, and documenation. Through the creation of our CRUD module we could integrate this with our dashboard that allowed the users from the company to create, update, and remove data in real time. This was also able to be seen visual from the GUI dashboard that was created for the users to filter data. This module can be used in future projects to be built upon or modified to meet the needs in other database operations and environments.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?




What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
